Instructions for Building a P2P File-Sharing Platform Using Cursor IDE and Advanced Models
Set Up Your Development Environment:

Open Cursor IDE.

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Verify by running node -v and npm -v in the terminal.

Install required global dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install -g express ws simple-peer nanoid
Create the Project Structure:

Create a new directory for your project:

bash
Copy
mkdir p2p-file-sharing
cd p2p-file-sharing
Initialize a new Node.js project:

bash
Copy
npm init -y
Create the following folder structure:

Copy
p2p-file-sharing/
├── backend/
│   ├── signaling-server.js
│   ├── generate-code.js
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── index.js
├── package.json
Set Up the Signaling Server:

In backend/signaling-server.js, add the provided signaling server code.

Start the signaling server:

bash
Copy
node backend/signaling-server.js
Implement Code Generation:

In backend/generate-code.js, add the code generation logic using nanoid.

Expose this functionality via an API endpoint in the signaling server.

Set Up WebRTC for P2P Communication:

Install simple-peer:

bash
Copy
npm install simple-peer
Implement sender and receiver logic as provided in the example code.

Implement File Streaming:

Use Node.js streams to handle file chunks.

Ensure the sender reads files in chunks and the receiver writes them accordingly.

Build the Frontend:

Use React.js for the UI. Set up a basic React app in the frontend folder.

Implement the UI for generating codes, entering codes, and displaying transfer progress.

Use fetch or axios to interact with the backend APIs.

Integrate Advanced Models (Claude 3.7):

Use the model for generating optimized code snippets, debugging, or suggesting improvements.

Integrate the model into Cursor IDE for real-time assistance during development.

Security Enhancements:

Implement encryption using WebRTC’s built-in DTLS/SRTP.

Add rate limiting and authentication mechanisms to prevent abuse.

Testing:

Test the platform locally by running the signaling server and connecting two devices.

Use tools like Postman or curl to test backend APIs.

Test file transfers of various sizes to ensure stability.

Deployment:

Deploy the signaling server to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku).

Deploy the frontend using Vercel or Netlify.

Use a CDN like Cloudflare for improved performance.

Advanced Features (Optional):

Implement resumable transfers by saving chunk metadata.

Add real-time progress tracking using WebSockets.

Optimize the platform for mobile devices using responsive design.

Documentation and Cleanup:

Document the codebase and API endpoints.

Remove any unused dependencies or code.

Write a README file with instructions for setting up and running the project.

Optimization and Scaling:

Use Redis for session management and scaling.

Optimize WebRTC configuration for better performance.

Implement load balancing for the signaling server if needed.

Final Testing and Debugging:

Perform end-to-end testing with multiple devices.

Use Cursor IDE’s debugging tools to fix any issues.

Optimize the platform based on feedback and testing results.

Launch and Monitor:

Deploy the final version of the platform.

Monitor performance and usage using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.

Gather user feedback for future improvements.
